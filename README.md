# 👋 Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.
## My name is Kennydt and my nickname is "SrKenny" or "FoxySin"!

I'm currently searching more about myself and what i like in this tech world.
My focus is in 2 things now:
  - 😃 Learning IA, to work with already exists technology, and trying to create one by myself(I really are inspired by Neuro-sama, created by vedal987🐢);
  - 🎮 Learning how to make games because i just love games.
   
## Estou aprendendo

 - <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon@latest/icons/python/python-plain-wordmark.svg" width="40" height="40"/> for IA   


I just love learning and discover new things!
